The wave ascii art, or Second, demonstrates both centering capabilities and a fun noise pattern. The more interesting piece of art is the spinning triforce from Zelda. I had atrted with just a still life triforce repeating and printing randomly, but then I realized it didn;t make sense lore wise. Instead I chose to mimic one of the cutscenes from the games, where the Triforce spins down from the heavens with sparkles surrounding it. I took the the Triforce and put it into a Google Sheets so it would be easier to work with. I then took the diagonal sides and made them alternate between slashes and |, leading to the effect of it getting thinner and spinning. I repeated this until I ended up with a line, meaning the animation was complete. I turned the 2D Triforce array into a 3D one to account for the frames, and made frames a part of the function.
